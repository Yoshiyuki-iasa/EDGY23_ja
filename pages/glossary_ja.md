## Business model

## Customer segment

## Data
Facts or information, especially when examined and used to find out things or to make decisions. [2]

## Ecosystem

The member organisms include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders.

## EDGY
An Open Source tool for co-creating better enterprises. EDGY stands for Enterprise Design Graph interplaY (see references to learn more).

## Employee

## Goal
An intended outcome that is aligned with the identity and strategy of the enterprise.

## Impact
Outcomes in our ecosystem that we only partially influence or control.

## Information
Facts or details about somebody/something. [2]

In EDGY information is modelled using the element object tagged as data.

## Initiative
A plan for dealing with a particular problem or for achieving a particular purpose. [2]

## Interface
Where two elements meet and interact, enabling flow passing data or other objects.

Example: data interface between applications, user interface communicating information to people.

In enterprise design, maps are used to represent the relationships between enterprise elements as part of a structured model, with a clarity suggestive of a geographical map.

## Media

Examples: software, print, screen, audio.

## Metric

In EDGY enterprise elements and relationships are used to create a model of (parts of) enterprises.

## Object (deterministic)
An object that is simple or complicated and can be engineered to exact specifications such as a machine or an application.

## Object (emergent)
An object that is complex and unpredictable and may be influenced to a certain degree only, because much of its form and function emerges from its interactions with other objects and its environment (like plants or social structures).

## Objective
A measurable, quantified goal with an associated timeframe.

## Organisational unit
A group of people working together to realise capabilities (e.g. teams, departments, committees, project teams)

All organisational units together form the organisation of the enterprise.

## User
A person using a product, asset or other object.

## Value
The quality of being useful or important. A belief about what is right and wrong and what is important in life. [2]

In enterprises, value is created as intended outcomes often outside the company when the right product supports the right tasks for the right people in the right context.

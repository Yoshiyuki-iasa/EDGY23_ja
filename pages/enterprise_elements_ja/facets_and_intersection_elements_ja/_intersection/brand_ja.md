# Brand
**Our name and what it stands for.**

## Description
A brand is a symbolic representation that stands for our enterprise and its products. It is designed to communicate our identity, especially how we are different from others. It invokes a set of expectations in people about our enterprise and our products, particularly in relation to people's own needs and desires. People have intentionally designed brand experiences through ads, public communications and their direct experiences with our products. In addition, people's perceptions of our brand is influenced by many other factors: any interaction they have with our products, processes and people; any public communication about our brand; any stories going around. Positive expectations about a brand pull people towards the products an enterprise offers, negative expectations push them away. That's why a brand is also a financial asset we invest in and obtain benefits from, by purposely creating awareness and improving or maintaining our reputation with our customers, partners and investors. Brand names are often protected as a registered trademark expressed in words, visual signs or other media representations.

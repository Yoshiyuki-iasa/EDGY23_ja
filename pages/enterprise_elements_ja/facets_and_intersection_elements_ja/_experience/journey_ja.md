# Journey
**The events and activities people experience in their lives.**

## Description
A journey describes what a person does, feels, thinks, or otherwise experiences over time as they live a specific portion of their life, in particular when interacting with our enterprise. It is captured as a simplified sequential and chronological representation of activities and events people experience, and tasks they want to accomplish. Journeys are commonly documented using a storytelling format, describing a slice of life of an exemplary person or persona. Aspects that are typically captured are motivation, activities, tasks, channels of interaction, physical or digital environments, emotional states, first-hand observations and analytics data related to the journey.

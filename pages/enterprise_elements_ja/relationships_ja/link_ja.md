# Link
**A meaningful structural association between two elements.**

A link expresses a structural relationship between two elements in terms that explain or illustrate the relevance of that relationship to the enterprise.

## Core links
EDGY provides a rich and expressive vocabulary, including twenty-four pre-defined types of links. Using these links will enable co-designers from different disciplines to better communicate and connect their specialised designs across their disciplines.


## Facet core links
**Identity**
- story contextualises purpose
- content expresses purpose
- content conveys story
**Experience**
- task is part of journey
- task uses channel
- journey traverses channel
**Architecture**
- capability requires asset
- process realises capability
- process requires asset

## Intersection core links
- organisation builds brand
- organisation makes product
- product embodies brand

## Product / Experience
- product serves task
- product features in journey

## Product / Architecture
- product requires capability
- process creates product

## Organisation / Identity
- organisation pursues purpose
- organisation authors story

## Organisation / Architecture
- organisation has capability
- organisation performs purpose

## Brand / Identity
- brand evokes story
- brand represents purpose

## Brand / Experience

## Mapping elements with core links
EDGY Mapping with Core Links (example)

## Shortcuts
In addition to the pre-defined core links, EDGY allows designers to bypass this model by defining custom links between elements. This creates a shortcut which can be broken down into several core links.

## Use
Shortcuts can be used to enrich the model further and tailor the language for specific design challenges. Designers should be aware, however, that the more custom links they introduce, the harder it will become to communicate and connect their designs to other disciplines.

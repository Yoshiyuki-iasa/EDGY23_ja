EDGY 23 is an Open Source tool for collaborative Enterprise Design. Intersection Group provides a collection of tools, both developed with our member community and made by partners. Many of these tools are available for free, or included for free in otherwise commercial licenses. Those tools help you with facilitating workshops, modelling EDGY diagrams or storing your enterprise elements in a repository.

More and more tools will be made available over time, we encourage you to download them and try them out to see what value they add to your work.

## Mappings
EDGY is not alone: in practice, it will be used together with other methods, approaches and tools. Here we provide mappings to use it together with complimentary tools and develop an integrated approach.

### EDGY and ArchiMate®
This mapping allows combining EDGY with ArchiMate®, an open and independent modelling language for Enterprise Architecture developed by The Open Group®. It is supported by different tool vendors, and can be used to create EDGY maps using its built-in specialisation mechanism.
